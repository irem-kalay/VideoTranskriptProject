 I just woke up from a dream, were you and I had to say goodbye? I don't know what it all means, but since I survived I realized Wherever you go that's where I'll follow, nobody's promised tomorrow So I would love you every night like it's the last night Like it's the last night, if the world was ending I want to be next to you If the party was over and our time on us was through I want to hold you just for a while And time with the smile Wherever you go that's where I'll follow, nobody's promised tomorrow So I would love you every night like it's the last night Like it's the last night, if the world was ending I want to be next to you If the party was over and our time on us was through I want to be next to you If the party was over and our time on us was through I want to hold you just for a while And time with the party was over and our time on us was through I want to hold you just for a while And time with the smile If the world was ending I want to be next to you If the party was over and our time on us was through If the party was over and our time on us was through If the world was ending I want to be next to you If the party was over and our time on us was through I want to hold you just for a while And time with the smile If the world was ending I want to be next to you If the world was ending I want to be next to you If the world was ending I want to be next to you
